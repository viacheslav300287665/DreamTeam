# Instructions for the project:

## 1. For Laravel to run: Go to laravel\LogoutPage, open cmd with current directory, enter php artisan serve (keep the cmd open and Composer is required)

## 2. For Codeigniter to run: Go to codeigniter\aboutpage, open cmd with current directory, enter php spark serve (keep the cmd open)

## 3. Two cmd shells should be open, one for laravel, one for codeigniter.

## 4. Finally, load the database from data/csis3280project.sql using VS Code.

## 5. Then by using wamp server, you can explore the project by going to pro-registration.php.
